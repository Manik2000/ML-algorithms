# ML-algorithms

## About
Python (`numpy`) implementations of various ML algorithms from different subfields like supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, clustering.
The main purpose of the project is to gain deeper insight into the workings of ML algorithms, going beyond simply performing `from sklearn ...`.

## Algorithms
Currently implemented algorithms are:
* Dense neural network,
* Principal Components Analysis (PCA),
* linear regression.

Many more to come, including:
* T-SNE,
* Decision Trees,
* K-nearest neighbors classifier and regressor,
* &hellip;
